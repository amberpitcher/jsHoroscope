Be aware that you might feel overshadowed or that your efforts won't be recognized, Scorpio. You could feel like you do all the work for others and get nothing in return. The key is to make sure that you do the things you do because you want to. Do them for you. Don't do them for others because you expect that they will do something for you in return.
