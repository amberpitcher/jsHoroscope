Things may get a bit hostile today, Aquarius. No one wants to budge from his or her position. You could be caught between mind and heart issues. Both sides are unforgiving and unwilling to give up control. Your best bet is to try to find compromise wherever possible. You may not get the exact solution you want, but you will get one that's workable for all parties involved.
